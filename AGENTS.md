# RGRr

The project has client and server components.

## Server

The server is implemented in Python, and is in the `server/` subdirectory.

See `server/README.md` for directory layout and commands for working with the server implementation.
You must activate the virtual environment in the server directory first, and if it doesn't exist
create the virtual environment. Further guidelines on working with the server are in
`server/AGENTS.md`.

## Client

The client is implemented in ClojureScript, and is in the `client/` subdirectory.
